## No in-person session, but 'self-study'

This week, there will be **no in-person session.** **Instead**, you should use the time to **develop a first sketch** of your final project.

I will offer **individual office hour for each student** in the week from **11.12. - 15.12.23** via Zoom. There, you can discuss this sketch with me and get early feedback. Please contact me about a specific date by the end of this week (08.12.23).

Of course, there will **additional office hours if needed** before Christmas (until 22.12.23) and after New Year's (from 03.01.24 onward).

Keep in mind that the **deadline for the final project** is January 18, 2024, 23:59.
