# Materials

For this week, have a look at these R markdown files:

-   The first R markdown file demonstrates how to create a nice custom theme for ggplot using the gapminder data. You can find it [here](https://ilias.uni-mannheim.de/goto.php?target=file_1439663_download&client_id=ILIAS).

-   The second R markdown file shows how to import data from the Federal Returning Officer in Germany and create a scatterplot of unemployment rate and AfD vote share at the constituency level for the 2021 German federal elections. You can find it [here](https://ilias.uni-mannheim.de/goto.php?target=file_1439664_download&client_id=ILIAS). You can download the .csv files either yourself (see the links in the R markdown files) or from [ILIAS](https://ilias.uni-mannheim.de/goto.php?target=fold_1439661&client_id=ILIAS).

Try to run both R markdown files. As always, you can try out new arguments or change values (e.g., colors, title size, ...). If this works, try to extend the code in the second R markdown file:

-   First, you will see that the code also imports data from the 2017 German federal election.
-   Next, create a new data frame that contains the 2017 and 2021 data.
-   Third, create a scatterplot of unemployment rate and AfD vote share and use year as facet.
-   Finally, apply the custom theme from the first R markdown file to this new plot.

Does your plot look like this?

You can find the solution [here](../session05_example_solution.qmd). **Try first without looking!**

## Visualizing amounts

"Beginner"

-   Try to run the ggparliament R markdown script (see Materials for week 4)

"Advanced"

-   Have a look at [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), choose one of the data sets, and visualize amounts

## Read

-   Chapter 8: Refine your plots, in Hiely, Data Visualization. [Link to free online version](https://socviz.co/refineplots.html)
-   Chapter 22: Titles, captions, and tables in Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization. [Link to free online version](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/figure-titles-captions.html)

## Think

-   Questions to think about for the readings:

    -   Do you still remember the CRAP principles? How do they relate to theme elements (e.g., title, captions, labels, ...) in ggplot?
