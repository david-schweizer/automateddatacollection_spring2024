## First plots

Using the R script from week 2, try to plot different data (filter different continents and/or years) with *geom_point().*

Don't be frustrated if it won't work! We will go in detail over the structure of *ggplot()* in this session.

-   More advanced: This [blog post by CÃ©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/) gives a nice overview of how to customize a plot. Give it a try to understand and run the code.

## Think

-   Questions to think about for the readings:

    -   What does *mapping data onto aesthetics* mean?

    -   At what point should we stop editing our graph? Can we always do "more"?
