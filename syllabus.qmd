## **Course description**

**\
**Against the background of the ever-increasing availability of
(unstructured) online data, the goal of this course is to equip the
students with the necessary skills to collect large quantities of data
for their own research projects, to process the data, and to automate
this workflow in a reproducible way.

The course introduces students to automated data collection using a very
practical approach with the R programming language. The course consists
of three major modules. First, you will be guided into the programming
language and learn the fundamentals of R. No prior experience with R is
necessary. Among other things, we will cover how to import, transform,
and visualize data. Second, we will focus on the workflow for
reproducible research. For example, this includes version control via
Github and how to communicate your results. Third, we will cover static
and dynamic web scraping as well as APIS’s from a conceptual perspective
and use these tools to collect web data. Finally, we will also learn how
to automate this process.

The goal of this course is to equip you with the skills to:

-   collect your own data

-   tidy, transform & visualize the data

-   communicate your data & (exploratory) results

-   collaborate with others along the workflow

Taking this course should not be an end in itself. The motivation for
this course is therefore twofold: First, these skills prepare you for
conducting empirical research (including term papers, BA or MA theses),
collaborating with other students / researchers, and communicating your
work. Second, mastering these skills also prepare you for a career
outside academia.

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with the R programming language.

## **Course requirements**

**Active participation and preparation:**

Active participation during our weekly sessions is important to get the
most out of this course. Engaging with the assigned readings is
essential for participation.

Use Slack to post any questions or discuss with your peers if you do not
understand concepts. I will also regularly check our Slack channel.

**Assignments during the semester (10% of your grade)**

There will be 2 (short) assignments during the semester. Here, you have
to demonstrate that you can apply the concepts/code presented during the
session on your own.

Deadlines:

-   Assignment 1: 12.03.2024 after the session -\> 19.03.2024 15:00
-   Assignment 2: 09.04.2024 after the session -\> 16.04.2024 15:00
-   ~~Assignment 3: 07.05.2024 after the session -\> 14.05.2024 15:00~~
-   ~~Assignment 4: 21.05.2024 after the session -\> 28.05.2024 15:00~~
    No mandatory assignment. Feel free to send me your code regarding
    the tasks for review.

**"Mid-term" assignments (15% of your grade)**

The mid-term assignment differs from the other assignments in scope and
length. Here, you should demonstrate your understanding of the
concepts/code covered in the first half of the semester (importing,
wrangling, and visualizing data).

Deadline: 09.04.2024 15:00

**Data project (75% of your grade):**

Instead of a term paper, you will work on a data project. Again, in this
final assignment, you need to demonstrate you understanding of the
concepts/code covered during the semester. The goal is that you build
your own data set using web scraping methods and present this data set.
Hence, the data project includes the following steps:

-   Collect own data using web scraping methods

-   Tidy and transform the data

-   Possibly enrich the data set with other data (sets)

-   Visualize your data

-   Present your data set using an interactive web application or an
    (interactive Quarto document)

-   Describe: How could you or other researchers make use of this data
    for empirical research - What might be possible research questions?

**In case of any questions or problems, please get in touch with me as
early as possible.** Late submission will result in grade deductions.

-   Group work (up to 3 students) is possible and encouraged for the
    data project. In case of group work, each student will receive the
    same grade)

<!-- -->

-   Submission via ILIAS. **Deadline:** August 06, 2024, 23:59.

## **Organization & Learning Resources**

**Course website, Slack, (and ILIAS):**

The plan is to use primarily the course website and Slack for providing
the structure of the seminar, materials, and communication,
respectively. Nevertheless, you will also receive mails via ILIAS. Make
sure to regularly check your university e-mail address.

If you have contacted me with a question via any channel and you did not
hear back after 2 days (except over the weekend), please just send me
your question again!

**Office hours:**

-   In-person (A 340) or via Zoom, Tuesday 13:45 -- 15:15, please make
    an appointment by e-mail.

-   If you have a specific question or problem (e.g., installing a
    specific package, finding a data source, etc.), please let me know
    before coming to the office hours. This way , I can also prepare for
    it and thereby making our meeting more productive and constructive.

**Illness (& Covid)**

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your
    fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

**Students with disabilities or chronic illnesses:**

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need
    special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses. And
    please do this early in the semester so that we can make the
    appropriate arrangements.

**If you need any support:**

Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable
with the question. It is important to note that the [University's
Equality and Diversity
Office](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gleichstellung/beratung/) supports
and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The
responsible contact person in such a case is Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfründer.
She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything
strictly confidential. No action will be taken without your express
consent. Further counseling services offered by the university can be
found via this
