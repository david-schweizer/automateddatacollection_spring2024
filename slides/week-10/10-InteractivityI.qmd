## Dashboards

-   Dashboards represent a tool for effective data visualization

-   They allow us to communicate information as intuitively as possible and can support data-driven decision making

-   We focus presenting our *results* and telling a story!

-   Dashboards are useful for science communication but also provide added value in other areas such as consulting, business, etc.

# Dashboards with felxdashboard

## flexdashboard & R Markdown

-   We can easily incorporate **multiple visualization** on one or multiple pages

-   **Different types of layouts** allow us to tell different stories

-   Most importantly, we can make our visualizations **interactive** using Shiny

-   In addition, it is **highly customizable**

## Shiny

-   Shiny is an R package that allows us to build interactive web applications in R

-   We will learn how to make standalone shiny apps in our second section on interactivity

-   However, we can also incorporate Shiny (interactive) elements in our flexdashboard
