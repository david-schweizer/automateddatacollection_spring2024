## Organisation & Resources

-   Materials will be provided via the course website (and ILIAS)

-   Communication via ILIAS and Slack. Make sure that you have access to the course on ILIAS and that emails that are sent over ILIAS are forwarded to the email account you check regularly

-   Weekly office hours after the course. Please make an appointment via e-mail

-   Access to Dataquest (Online learning platform for programming languages and more)

## Covid-19

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

## Disabilities

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.

-   And please do this early in the semester so that we can make the appropriate arrangements immediately.

## Support

    -   to process large quantities of data

    -   to clean and arrange datasets

    -   to explore and understand patterns of data

    -   to communicate these patterns and findings

## Read

-   Chapter 1: Look at data in Healy, Data Visualization

-   Chapter 2: The Five Qualities of Great Visualizations in Cairo, The Truthful Art

## Think

-   Questions to think about for the readings

    -   Why do we use visualizations?

    -   What do we need in order to create great visualizations?

    -   How do we determine what kind of visualization should be used? (Bar plot, pie chart,...)
